What is Go good at?
------------------
problem it's trying to solve: google team built. 
they used c++, java and python

each language has it's advantages and disadvantages

c++: high performance, type safety - slow compilation, complex syntax

java: rapid compilation, type safety - complicated ecosystem

python: ease of use - lack of type safety, relatively slow

solution: GO!


Characteristics
---------------
~Fast compliation
~Fully complied 
~Strongly typed 
~Concurrent by default (what does that mean? multithreading was expected)
~Garbage collected
~Simplicity as a core value


So wtf is it good at?
-------------------
+ web services
+ web apps
~ task automation (syntax is almost as light as scripting languages)
~ gui/thick-client (expir)
~ ml
???



Syntax
------
module ~= workspace
init a module go mod init name of module

go recognizes module path

Quirks
-----
packages that aren't being used will throw a compliation error
formatted with tabs
whitespace isn't critical but encouraged
compiler adds semicolons

Opinions
--------
